# Core Improvements Swarm

## Summary and Goal(s)

Status Core Improvements swarm's goal is the preparation of Status Mobile Client to be released publicly (AppStore/GP release tracks).

A few key areas that we need to focus on:

* all the critical security and privacy issues are resolved (including audit);
    - a security and privacy document is delivered (it lists guarantees we make around security and privacy; as well as ways we are falling short)

* all the critical tech debt issues are resolved;
* key UX problems are solved in two areas:
    - adoption issues;
    - retention issues.

The work includes releasing internal "dogfood" builds as well as betas in preparation to the public release.
