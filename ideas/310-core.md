# Core Team
## Summary and Goal(s)
Status Core is responsible for implementing a decentralized, reliable Ethereum reference client for Mobile on Android and iOS. This client should provide a reliable communication medium and ability to access the open decentralized web.

Mobile: The highest priority is to prepare Status to the public release in terms of performance and reliability.

Desktop: support and make usable for core contributors; do releases and merge codebases as much as possible.

Core needs an accountable, passionate get-shit-done mentality and drive, in contrast to the meandering blame-shifting.
