This should probably be filled out similar to Ideas template, but this will do as a skeleton.

The Core Desktop team is a client team that is focused on the Desktop client of Status. It gets support and is enabled by the Infra and P2P team, and it supports the product teams chat, wallet, and dapps.

Current state of it is focused on getting everyone to use Status everyday at their desktop.
