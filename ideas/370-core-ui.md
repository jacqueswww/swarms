# Core-UI

## Q2 critical path

**SNT utility features**

SNT utility features take priority over new items.

_Sticker Market:_ ToB audit kicked off 26/4. Estimated time for completion is 1-2 weeks. Feature launch date dependent upon issues found.

_TtT:_ [Two remaining issues](https://github.com/status-im/status-react/issues?q=is%3Aissue+is%3Aopen+label%3Atribute-to-talk) being bountied; Eric/Vitaliy fixing issues found in QA on core flows. ToB will audit after stickers. Same procedure as stickers, but the feature will require two release cycles to go public. One to introduce it settings option behind a flag and chat flow introduced; the second with both. This is to ensure that users who don't update from client n-1 to client n will still be able to interact with users who set tributes. Could be an issue for users who don't update from client n-2 or n-3.
