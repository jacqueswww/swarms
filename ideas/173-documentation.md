## Product Overview

The Status wiki is collecting cobwebs. Much of the information is out-of-date and further, the wiki hasn't gained traction as a resource.

The goal of the wiki is to share knowledge and make it easy for developers to get involved with Status. This swarm aims to better fulfill that need by:

1. Updating existing content and proposing additional, if appropriate
2. Building a static site to host our documentation (reference [Embark](https://embark.status.im/docs/))
3. Forming a strategy to keep documentation up-to-date in the future

**Update existing content and propose additional**
- A team of contributors will review the existing wiki and mark content as `irrelevant`, `relevant/outdated`, or `relevant/current`.
- Swarm will gather a list of additional documentation that should be written or included by working with teams across the organization. 
- Additional documentation is not required for the completion of this swarm; the main emphasis is on migrating the wiki materials and creating a process for future docs.

**Build static site to host documentation**
- During a [discussion on Slack](https://status-im.slack.com/archives/CAB6WB38X/p1525340980000332), it was agreed that a static site which contributors can write to in markdown is a happy solution for now.
- Swarm will decide on a potential architecture of information for the documentation site. 
- Site to be hosted on Github Pages, same as Embark and ethprize.io.
- Swarm will decide on a static site generator to use, or to build from scratch.

**Strategy to keep documentation up-to-date**
- Swarm will propose a workflow that teams can follow to keep documentation up-to-date.
- Swarm will get feedback and buy-in on the strategy.

### User Stories

- A developer follows the quick start to build Status on their device and begin working on a status-react issue.
- A developer learns about Status’ handling of push notifications, mail servers and messaging by reading the docs.
- A developer follows the extensions documentation to build a native integration for their DApp. [future scenario]

### Requirements & Dependencies

Participation from Core teams to create and edit documentation. 

### Security and Privacy Implications


## Dates

TBD once swarm participants are identified.


### Minimum Viable Product

Goal Date: 2018-06-08

Description:
- Wiki content is reviewed
- New content proposed—should we include Readmes? *New content is not a requirement*
- v1 content architecture agreed upon
- Website generator, if using, agreed upon—[Gatsby](https://www.gatsbyjs.org/), [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/)? 

### Iteration 1

Goal Date:

Description:
- Existing wiki content is updated
- Any new content in progress
- Design assets for site prepared

### Iteration 2

Goal Date:

Description:
- Website created, content migrated
- Plan for maintaining documentation proposed

Note: translatiosn can also be considered at this stage.

## Success Metrics

- A developer can complete a set of required tasks by following the Status documentation.
- Community feedback is positive.

## Exit criteria

- New Status documentation website is live
- Organization-wide buy-in for maintaining documentation
