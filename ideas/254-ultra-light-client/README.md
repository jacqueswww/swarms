## Preamble

    Idea: 254-ultra-light-client
    Title: Integration of ULC in Status
    Status: Draft
    Created: 2018-05-02

## Summary

Current LES is not yet optimized for ultra-light devices like mobile phones. So in the first step introduce
the ULC addressing this kind of clients.

## Product Overview

Current LES is not optimized for usage on mobile phones. So Status is using Infura with all its assets and
drawbacks. ULC is addressing ultra-light clients and distribution without dependency to central providers.
Instead a network of trusted LES nodes acts as counterpart for the protocol.

So Status is supporting the development and testing of ULC to accelerate integration into `go-ethereum` as
well as into Status itself.

### Product Description

- Research of ULC design
- Definition and implementation of ULC
- Integrate ULC in `statusd` and the `lib`
- Documentation

### Minimum Viable Product

Goal Date: 2018-07-02
Working board: https://github.com/status-im/go-ethereum/projects/5

Description:

- [ ] New Ultra Light Client mode is added to patched LES
- [ ] Integrate ULC with `status-go` with Status nodes as trusted nodes
- [ ] Collect metrics (CPU, mem, disk, network I/O) when starting with a branch new install and after 1h of inactivity
- [ ] Keep battery and network consumption at least as low as today with Infura

### Iteration 2018-05-21 - 2018-06-04

Goal Date: 2018-06-04

Description:

- [x] Fix [downloader N/M validation](https://github.com/status-im/go-ethereum/issues/51)
- [x] Fix [announce type on handshake](https://github.com/status-im/go-ethereum/issues/55)
- [x] [ULC config refactoring](https://github.com/status-im/go-ethereum/issues/52)
- [x] PR to `go-ethereum`

### Iteration 2018-06-04 - 2018-06-18

Goal Date: 2018-06-18

Description:
[ULC milestone 2018-06-04](https://github.com/status-im/go-ethereum/milestone/1)


### Iteration 2018-06-18 - 2018-07-02

Goal Date: 2018-07-02

Description:
[ULC milestone 2018-06-18](https://github.com/status-im/go-ethereum/milestone/2)

## Artifacts

- None

## Success Metrics

LES of `go-ethereum` is extended to use ULC with a similar or better use of bandwidth and CPU as Infura.
